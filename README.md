# CVC Stats
This is a simple and fun project that connects to the Hypixel developer API to find player stats. You can lookup a player and see some of their stats for the cops vs. crims gamemode (also called MCGO, at least in the Hypixel API it is).

This is my first [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project which uses React Query and Next.js API routes. It is still a work in progress and I want to improve the UI and add sharable links for specific players. 

This project is deployed to Vercel and you can do the same if you want. Just follow the deploy steps for Next.js, set the environment variable `HYPIXEL_API_KEY`, and publish. You can create a developer account at Hypixel an [register a development](https://developer.hypixel.net/dashboard) key if you want to play around with a copy of this app.
